I am a confident and ambitious **Junior Full Stack Developer** based in London. With a strong analytical mind, I have embarked on a career change where I can put my skills to better use.

After recruiting software developers in Sydney, I became fascinated by the intricate details of the Development landscape. Currently undertaking the intensive 12 weeks of [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), I have grown from someone with an interest in code, to someone who is incredidbly passionate about writing clean code using best practices. 

I am currently looking for a role within an ambitious company that promotes learning and collaboration in a team enviornment, where I can consolodate and extend my programming knowledge surrounded by like-minded professionals.

#### Communication

With a background in sales, communication is what my previous career has been based on. During my sales career in London and Sydney, I have dealt with professionals from all walks of life, developing my verbal and written communication skills in high-pressured enviornments. From buidling relationships with a CTO at a major Fintech, to helping a Developer get their first job oversea's, I have succeeded in every sales position I have held. I regularly attend Meetups in and around London and love meeting new people.

#### Initiative

Whilst at University, I created a sports trading business to help fund myself. I noticed a gap in the market within the industry and for 2 years, worked on a trading platform making consistent profit. In Sydney, I joined a start-up branch of a larger recruitment organisation and helped develop the brand. Using London's style of recruitment was not working and we came up with numerous solutions to help us in a Sydney market (regular tech Meetups, graduate developer programmes, etc).

#### Analytical

During my time as a Bookmaker, I had to analyse price-movements and fluctuations on a daily basis to give suggestions to our team. Whilst working in sales, I was always analytical over my pipeline management and when choosing what clients were right for certain candidates and vice versa.

#### Time-Management

Throughout my sales career, time-management has been hugely important. Breaking the day up into manageable chunks works well for me and having the flexibility to move these around when something urgent happens is something I excel at. Key to good time-management is good organisation. In my previous sales role I implemented a priority scale for the team so we could break down our day based on what our biggest priorities were during that day.
